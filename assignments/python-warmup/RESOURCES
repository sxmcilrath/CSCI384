(Report here on what resources you used---classmates, Github CoPilot, 
Python documentation, StackOverflow, etc. Did this help you learn, or 
did it hinder you from figuring it out on your own?)

Looked up on google what does a dictionary return in python when you try to access a value that isn't there then 
found the .get() method and then just looked up python dictionary documentation as well.
