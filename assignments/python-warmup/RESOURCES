Python documentation, StackOverflow, etc. Did this help you learn, or 
did it hinder you from figuring it out on your own?)

-Looked up on google what does a dictionary return in python when you try to access a value that isn't there then 
found the .get() method and then just looked up python dictionary documentation as well.
-Googled how to find index of char in string.
-googled how to replace char in string -> strings are immutable -> found a stack overflow post using .join with a list
-looked up how to do foreach loop/enumeration for string
-made sure you can subtract chars in python, just googled that

After all my answers passed I put everything into GPT and asked what was the most efficient way to do all of this.
Didn't use those answers but just wanted to see what capabilities python has that I didn't know existed.
